Actually before the answers, I just want to roast whoever wrote the example code for using whatever font they're using. I'm just so confused on why someone would pick CURSIVE letters.

1) Printed 3.   So it just prints out the value of i after the for loop ended. This is the number that caused the for loop to exit. It makes sense because  i < prices.length is 3 < 3.  
NOTE: This is a variable that's declared in the for loop, but has function scope.
